	<br>
	<li>Roman Bridger vs. Mickey Altieri (Scream 2): Mickey is driven by a desire for fame, but Roman's intelligence and resourcefulness would likely give him the upper hand in a fight.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Roman Bridger vs. Jill Roberts (Scream 4): Jill is intelligent and manipulative, similar to Roman. This fight would be the most evenly matched, but Roman's experience and mastery of manipulation may give him a slight edge.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Roman Bridger vs. Charlie Walker (Scream 4): Charlie is loyal to Jill but lacks the same level of strategic thinking as Roman. Roman's intelligence and cunning would likely lead to his victory in this confrontation.></li>

<h2>Motive</h2>

<p>Roman Bridger's motive in the "Scream" franchise is primarily driven by a desire for revenge and recognition. He is revealed to be the mastermind behind many of the events that occur throughout the series, particularly in "Scream 3."

	Roman's motive stems from his belief that he was abandoned by his mother, Maureen Prescott, who is also the mother of Sidney Prescott, the main protagonist of the series. Roman discovers his true parentage later in life and feels resentful towards Maureen for not being part of his life. He harbors a deep-seated anger towards Maureen and seeks to take revenge on her and her family.
	
	Additionally, Roman is motivated by a desire for recognition and fame. He is revealed to have orchestrated the Ghostface killings as part of a twisted plan to become a famous filmmaker. By creating a real-life horror story and framing Sidney Prescott as the ultimate survivor, Roman aims to elevate his own status and achieve the recognition and success he feels he deserves.
	
	Overall, Roman's motive is a complex combination of personal vendetta, unresolved familial issues, and a twisted desire for fame and recognition in the world of filmmaking.</p>
